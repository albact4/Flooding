              How did we get to the flooding simulations?

              <div class="answer">     
                <p>To create our flash flooding simulations and hazard intensity maps, we required three key components: rainfall data, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and land cover information.

                  <<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Rainfall Data Analysis: We performed Probability Density Function (PDF) analysis on hourly rainfall data spanning 18 years. This data, collected at hourly intervals, enabled us to identify 10-year rainfall events, a crucial parameter for our simulations.
                  
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Digital Elevation Model (DEM): Utilizing the DEM, we pinpointed specific areas of interest and generated the necessary mesh for our simulations. The DEM provided essential topographical information for our modeling.
                  
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Land Cover Assessment: To account for flow resistance related to vegetation types, we examined land cover data. We applied Manning coefficients to our dataset, allowing us to incorporate vegetation characteristics into our simulations.
                  
                  <br><br>By integrating these three components, we successfully developed our flash flooding simulations and subsequently produced hazard zone maps.

                <p>The areas of interest were defined as a draining area that contributes to the Kanawha River, WV 
                  by means of a polygon determined in <a href="https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/waters-geoviewer" target="_blank">https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/waters-geoviewer</a>. 
                  Such polygon was a GEOJSON file used in QGIS. 
                  <br><br>Using the RiverFlow2D plugin from Hydronia ( <a href="https://www.hydronia.com/riverflow2d" target="_blank">https://www.hydronia.com/riverflow2d</a>), the simulation needed the following information: 
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Raster file of the topography or DEM.  
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The shapefile determining the Manning coefficient which was determined from the raster 
                  file of the land cover after a conversion to a shapefile with the Manning coefficient as an attribute. 
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) The precipitation regime described by the bell curve. 
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) The outflow which was defined manually in the lower zone of the area of interest. 
                  <br><br>First, the RiverFlow2D project was created with a coordinate reference system EPSG 32617.  
                  <br><br>Second, a triangular mesh was generated with 20m of the element size resolution. 
                  <br><br>Third, the files were exported to RiverFlow2D engine. 
                  <br><br>  Fourth, settings for the simulation were as follows: 
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Simulation time 3h
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Output interval 0.1h
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Courant number (CFL) equal to 1
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) The rainfall/evaporation component was activated
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) With output maximum and output hazard files
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f) Dry bed initial conditions. Fourth, it was used the RF2D Animation to generate the velocity 
                  field animation. 
                  <br><br>Fifth, it was used the Hazard Intensity Maps in the Results vs Time to choose the Swiss Method for 
                  Water Flooding in order to generate a shapefile with the four categories (low hazard, low danger zone, 
                  medium zone and high danger zone).

                  A maximum rainfall for a 10-year expected event was 38.68mm/h. The rain event followed a bell curve 
                  over a period of 3h. The duration of 3h is empirically defined, however, it is suggested between 1h and 
                  3h for flash flooding events (Fowler et al., 2021). The rainfall development over time adjusted to a bell 
                  curve provided information of the rainfall impact under increasing, maximum and decreasing rainfall causing 
                  a total of 225 mm.

                <p>Infiltration was not considered to simplify simulations and challenging methods to identify proper settings. 
                  Additionally, flash flooding is happening in a short period of time, then, infiltration may become marginal; 
                  this assumption is valid for soils with minimum content of sand, which is our case ( <a href="https://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/" target="_blank">https://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/</a>). 
                 
                  <br><br>Evapotranspiration was not included in these simulations since it is a marginal effect during a 3h-period of the rainfall.
                  
                  <br><br>Raster files used in these simulations were not edited so infrastructure such as culvers, bridges and other special constructions draining water were not considered in these simulations.
